Jekyll is a web-framework written in Ruby for creating *static* pages.
If you're unfamiliar with the term, *static* means that it can take a set of
input files and turn it into a site that's linked up very nicely, but cannot
provide any interaction with the user, nor can it react to it's environment by
using a web-server. Interactivity is still available on the client-side through
the use of javascript of course.

Jekyll is very good at things like making informational sites, or even simple
blogs. It will parse markdown and load it into templates for you, which makes it
quick and easy to write content for your site. If creating a blog is something
that interests you, also check out [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), which is
a blog framework built on top of Jekyll.

If you've always wanted your own blog, or even just want to get started learning
out to create a website, now is a good a time as any. Jekyll and Octopress
integrate perfectly with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which allow
you to host static sites completely free!

TLDR:

* Jekyll is a quick and easy static site framework.
* Host a blog for free on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

If you want to check out the source it's available on the Jekyll
[Github page](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
